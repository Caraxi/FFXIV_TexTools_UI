                    This tool will make a COPY of your Penumbra library which is fully updated to Dawntrail, to the best of TexTools' ability.
                    <LineBreak/>However, not all content can be upgraded to Dawntrail, and it is possible some individual mods may fail.
                    <LineBreak/>
                    <LineBreak/>Mods which fail to convert will be copied over as-is, and noted in the results list.
                    <LineBreak/>Additionally, unused files in modpacks will not be upgraded, and are copied over as-is into the result.
                    
                    <LineBreak/>
                    <LineBreak/>You may pause and resume the process at any time, and your progress will be saved as long as you are copying to/from the same directory.
                    <LineBreak/>
                    <LineBreak/>This process may take some time.
                    <LineBreak/>You MAY play FFXIV during the process, but please do not use TexTools or Penumbra while it is working.
                    <LineBreak/>
                    <LineBreak/>Once this process is complete, you may replace your original Penumbra library folder with the new copy.
                    <LineBreak/>At this time, we do not offer in-place library upgrades for safety reasons.  This may change later.
